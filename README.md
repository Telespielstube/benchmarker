### Benchmarker

In this project, the validation loss and the validation accuracy of three optimizers 
by changing the batch size in the area of ​​convolutional neural are to be investigated. 
The optimizers used here are Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), 
Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam) and Layer-wise Adaptive Moments optimizer for Batch training (LAMB). 
The cross-entropy loss function was used to classify the data. 
The results of the training and validitaion runs are plotted in diagrams according 
to loss values and validation accuracy.
